# Deutsch Grammatik
A website for practicing German grammar using spaced repetition.

## Motivation
Spaced repetition flash card software is great for learning vocabulary but it is not ideal for learning grammar.
I decided to build a spaced repetition system for learning grammar rules that varies the content of the flash
card for a given rule each time it is seen while keeping the content applicable for that rule.
