# Deutsch Grammatik
A website for practicing German grammar using spaced repetition.

[![Coverage](coverage.svg)](http://codecov.io/github/nedbat/coveragepy?branch=master)

## Motivation
Spaced repetition flash card software is helpful for learning vocabulary but it is not ideal for learning grammar.
I decided to build a spaced repetition system for learning grammar rules that varies the content of the flash
card for a given rule each time it is seen while keeping the content applicable for that rule.

## Grammar Topics
- [x] Deklination (Declension)
  - [x] Identify Gender
  - [ ] Identify Case
  - [ ] Identify Declension
- [ ] Konjugation (Conjugation)
  - [ ] Topics TBD
- [ ] Wortstellung (Word Order)

## Features

- [x] 44 Gender Rules Covering ~60% of the 5,000 Nouns
- [ ] Sample Sentences for Identifying Cases and Declension
- [ ] Automatic Detection of Obvious Cases in Sample Sentences
